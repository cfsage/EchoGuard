<!-- This file should be replaced with an actual 128x128 PNG image.
     For the purpose of this demonstration, below is a description of what
     the EchoGuard icon could look like:
     
     A shield or guard badge in blue gradient (#4a6cf7 to #2e4dd4)
     with a sound wave or echo pattern in white overlaid on it.
     The design should be simple and recognizable at small sizes,
     conveying the idea of protection against misleading information.
